                  <p>(1) digital and physical space<br>
In the early stages of this project, we were interested in the link and expansion of the physical structure of the library. How exactly could we use public interest technology to expand the range that libraries have? We discovered a pre-existing solution, book mobiles, that have the capacity to deliver digital library resources to those most out of reach. However, we also realized through our analysis of this solution that the distribution was still inequitable in our case study concerning the Houston Public Library. Thus, this app seeks to use features such as maps and request forms on a technological platform to facilitate connections between librarians and users to better distribute resources provided by the library.</p>

                  <p>(2) community programming<br>
By identifying crucial processes that users have trouble navigating, such as the online portals, editable PDFs, unemployment forms, taxes, etc., we developed a platform that provides resources that can be easily understood within a technology that is widely accessible. This same platform connects those in need with librarians and resources that are more difficult to reach. Features such as the request form help keep librarians up to date on what needs their audience has and gives individuals a space to voice their concerns.</p>

                  <p>(3) resource distribution (equity and accessibility)<br>
The Houston Public Library already has a pre-existing mobile bus service (two BookMobiles), but its current model of responding to patron requests or existing partnered institutions for distributing these resources creates gaps in their solution to do so. This app hopes to supply librarians with a tool that informs them on neighborhoods and locations that need the most help and have the most issues accessing their library resources.</p>
