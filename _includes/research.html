                    <p><br>Phase 1 clarifies multiple insights concerning how mobile library services may not be equitably implemented. The history of these services suggest they are not sustainable literally and figuratively-- of the 9,057 public libraries across the United States, only 650 BookMobile programs exist. This number has shrunk in recent decades due to the cost of operation and inability to adapt to the changing needs of library patrons and the public. How and why these services are offered vary greatly between systems too; some are determined by patron requests, others by proximity (or lack thereof) to existing facilities. How might mobile library services be more systematized in order to reach underserved populations and become critical infrastructure of the public library? What are the new or important programs that need to be designed for an adaptive reuse of existing units?</p>

                    <p>Use case scenario research (steps of unemployment filing)
Unemployment in Texas is run completely by the Texas Workforce Commission and due to COVID- 19, is restricted to application by online portal and phone. This further limits the abilities of those who find themselves unemployed or have been economically affected by COVID-19 and must now apply for unemployment benefits. Many who must now endure the struggle of this bureaucratic process are predisposed to limited digital resource access and time/ financial constraints that further complicate their ability to apply and receive these benefits.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>The closure of physical locations of the Texas Workforce Commission leaves many individuals seeking to file for unemployment without human guidance through a complicated process. With their only options left being either an automated phone system or an online portal, their opportunities are greatly diminished. Additionally, the latter, which is a significantly clearer system to deal with, leaves those without access to computers with only one solution.

Taking into consideration what devices users have the most access to, we decided that a smartphone app would allow for most people to access the services we design.

                    <p>User A is a Houston Public Library patron named Jane, someone with access to a smartphone to use the app, but with little access to other resources necessary to successfully navigate society. Since she lives in an area in Houston with no access to public transportation, it is difficult for her to get around and find time to go to the library while balancing taking care of her kids and other responsibilities. Additionally, as she is an immigrant and English is her second language, understanding the already difficult unemployment process is hard for her to manage on her own after losing her job at a local restaurant suddenly due to COVID-19.</p>

                    <p>Our second user, User B, is a part time public librarian named Doug, who is a native of the area and well- versed in the bureaucratic processes involved in filing for government aid. He is also bilingual and is passionate about those who have difficulty completing these troublesome tasks. However, Doug has limited time to operate the Mobile Service, as he has another job, and has difficulty knowing where exactly library services are most needed.</p>
