                    <p><br>Phase 1 clarifies multiple insights concerning how mobile library services may not be equitably implemented. The history of these services suggest they are not sustainable literally and figuratively-- of the 9,057 public libraries across the United States, only 650 BookMobile programs exist. This number has shrunk in recent decades due to the cost of operation and inability to adapt to the changing needs of library patrons and the public. How and why these services are offered vary greatly between systems too; some are determined by patron requests, others by proximity (or lack thereof) to existing facilities. How might mobile library services be more systematized in order to reach underserved populations and become critical infrastructure of the public library? What are the new or important programs that need to be designed for an adaptive reuse of existing units?</p>

Unemployment in Texas is run completely by the Texas Workforce Commission and due to COVID- 19, is restricted to application by online portal and phone. This further limits the abilities of those who find themselves unemployed or have been economically affected by COVID-19 and must now apply for unemployment benefits. Many who must now endure the struggle of this bureaucratic process are predisposed to limited digital resource access and time/ financial constraints that further complicate their ability to apply and receive these benefits.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>The closure of physical locations of the Texas Workforce Commission leaves many individuals seeking to file for unemployment without human guidance through a complicated process. With their only options left being either an automated phone system or an online portal, their opportunities are greatly diminished. Additionally, the latter, which is a significantly clearer system to deal with, leaves those without access to computers with only one solution.

Taking into consideration what devices users have the most access to, we decided that a smartphone app would allow for most people to access the services we design.
